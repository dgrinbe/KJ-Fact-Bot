My name is David, and this is my first ever github project. This bot uses the Tweepy library and the Twitter API. Its not the most elegant implementation, however, I created this as a practice project. I'm planning on eventually uploading this to Amazon Web-hosting, and running the program on a Lambda function. In the meanwhile, I'll be running this project using a batch file (.BAT).
  
Feel free to leave comments, or DM the bot if you have any questions.
